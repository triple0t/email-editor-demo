# MailPoet Email Renderer

**The renderer is Work In Progress (WIP) and so is the API for adding support email rendering for new blocks**.

## Adding support for a core block

1. Add block into `ALLOWED_BLOCK_TYPES` in `packages/php/email-editor/src/Engine/SettingsController.php`.
2. Make sure the block is registered in the editor. Currently all core blocks are registered in the editor.
3. If necessary, add BlockRender class (e.g. Heading) into `packages/php/email-editor/src/Integrations/Core/Renderer/Blocks/` folder. <br />

```php
<?php declare(strict_types = 1);

namespace MailPoet\EmailEditor\Integrations\Core\Renderer\Blocks;

use MailPoet\EmailEditor\Engine\Settings_Controller;

class Heading extends AbstractBlockRenderer {
  protected function renderContent($blockContent, array $parsedBlock, Settings_Controller $settingsController): string {
    return $blockContent;
  }
}

```

4. Register the renderer

```php
<?php

use MailPoet\EmailEditor\Engine\Renderer\ContentRenderer\Blocks_Registry;

add_action('mailpoet_blocks_renderer_initialized', 'register_my_block_email_renderer');

function register_my_block_email_renderer(Blocks_Registry $blocksRegistry): void {
  $blocksRegistry->add_block_renderer('core/heading', new Renderer\Blocks\Heading());
}
```

Note: For core blocks this is currently done in `packages/php/email-editor/src/Integrations/Core/Initializer.php`.

5. Implement the rendering logic in the renderer class.

## Tips for adding support for block

- You can take inspiration on block rendering from MJML in the https://mjml.io/try-it-live
- Test the block in different clients [Litmus](https://litmus.com/)
- You can take some inspirations from the HTML renderer by the old email editor

## TODO

- add support for all core blocks
- move the renderer to separate package
