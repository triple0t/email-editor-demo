# MailPoet Email Editor

This folder contains the code for the MailPoet Email Editor PHP Package.
We aim to extract the engine as an independent library, so it can be used in other projects.
As we are still in an exploration phase, we keep it together with the MailPoet codebase.

You can locate the JS package here `packages/js/email-editor`

## Workflow Commands
We use `composer` run scripts to run the commands. You can run them using `composer run <command>`.
If you don't have `composer` installed globally, you can use the `composer.phar` file in `../mailpoet/tools/vendor`.

```bash
composer run unit-test                             # runs all the unit tests
composer run unit-test -- [path_to_tests]          # runs a single unit test or a directory of tests
composer run integration-test                      # runs all the integrations tests
composer run integration-test -- [path_to_tests]   # run a single integration test or a directory of tests
composer code-style                                # checks the code style
```
Example:
```bash
# To run test cases defined in tests/integration/Engine/Theme_Controller_Test.php run
composer run integration-test -- tests/integration/Engine/Theme_Controller_Test.php
```

## Development

The **PHP** package is divided into `engine` and `integrations` subdirectories.
Engine consist of code for the editor core and integrations are for extending the functionality.
Anything **MailPoet** specific should be in the `mailpoet/lib/EmailEditor/Integrations` folder.

Please avoid using MailPoet-specific services and modules in the Email editor package.

### Renderer
#### Content Renderer
* Responsible for rendering saved template + email content to HTML or email clients
* Flow is Preprocessors > BlocksRenderer > Postprocessors

#### Root Renderer.php
* Takes the rendered content html and places it into email HTML template template-canvas.php (We have too many items we call ‚Äútemplate‚Äù I know üôÅ)

### Integrations
Please locate MailPoet PHP integrations [here](https://github.com/mailpoet/mailpoet/tree/13bf305aeb29bbadd0695ee02a3735e62cc4f21f/mailpoet/lib/EmailEditor/Integrations/MailPoet)


## Known rendering issues

- In some (not all) Outlook versions the width of columns is not respected. The columns will be rendered with the full width.

## TODO
- We use `mailpoet_data` in some section of the codebase. This will be updated.
- The content validation in the editor looks for the unsubscribe link tag, which is registered in the MailPoet plugin. We need either introduce generic unsubscribe link tag or move the validation to the MailPoet plugin.
